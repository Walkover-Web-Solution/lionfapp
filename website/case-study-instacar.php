            <h3>Company Creation</h3>
            <p>Every time a new fleet partner joins Instacar, they need to submit a form on Instacar website. These details are sent to Giddh via API and a new company is created in <span class="pClr">Giddh</span> <a href="https://giddh.com" title="accounting software">accounting software</a> with a fleet partner name. This entire process happens without any human intervention.</p>
            
            <h3 class="mrT4">Request to make advance payment</h3>
            <p>At Instacar every booking confirm after advanced payment. So, Instacar integrated Razorpay with <span class="pClr">Giddh</span> to send payment request via invoice. This increased their total number of confirmation booking and rides.</p>

            <h3 class="mrT4">Invoicing</h3>
            <p>Instacar sends invoice after the end of the ride to their customer and fleet partner. Due to their integration with <span class="pClr">Giddh</span>, all invoices are sent instantly and automatically. This invoice automation process has reduced their Accounting team's efforts.</p>
