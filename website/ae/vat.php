          <h3><strong>What's VAT?</strong></h3>
          <p>Value Added Tax is an indirect tax and is applied in 180+ countries around the world. That includes all the OECD countries except the United States. While the final consumer pays this tax, the business collects and calculates this tax. That way business becomes the tax collector for the Federal Tax Authority. Basically, VAT is levied at each stage of the supply chain.</p>
            <br>
          <h3><strong>What’s VAT charged on?</strong></h3>
          <p>The Government of UAE charges VAT as an indirect tax on the use of goods and services. As stated before, it is levied at each step of the supply chain and the end consumer bears the cost of VAT. Registered businesses, however, need to collect and account for VAT.</p>          
            <br>
          <h3><strong>Why is UAE charging VAT now?</strong></h3>
          <p>The Government of UAE plans to use VAT collection revenue to finance public services in order to improve them. VAT is expected to generate AED 12 billion in the first year and up to AED 20 billion in the second year as revenue. The government plans to enhance public services such as education, public transport, healthcare and social services through this revenue.</p>
            <br>
          <h3><strong>From when is VAT chargeable?</strong></h3>
          <p>VAT will be chargeable from January 1st, 2018. The electronic registration portal for VAT will be open from the fourth quarter of 2017 on the FTA website. Businesses and industries have started to register online by logging into their website from October 1st 2017.</p>
            <br>
          <h3><strong>How’s VAT charged at each step of supply chain?</strong><br>Here’s how –</h3>
          <p>A producer manufactures a washing machine that he sells to a wholesaler for AED 1,500. This producer collects a VAT of 5% (AED 75) from the wholesaler who pays AED 1,575. Now the wholesaler sells the same product for AED 2,500 and sells it to retailer. The wholesaler must collect 5% (AED 125) from the retailer, while the former also receives a refund of the VAT paid to the producer earlier. So the retailer pays AED 2,625. The retailer decides the price to be AED 3,500 and levies a VAT of 5% on this price (AED 175). He receives a refund of the VAT paid to the wholesaler and charges the final price from customer as AED 3,675.</p>
          <p>The Federal Tax Authority (FTA) has specified a fixed VAT rate of 5% for the sale of goods and services in the UAE.</p>

            <br>
            <h3><strong>A voluntary registration:</strong></h3>

            <p>Small scale businesses and startups can opt for registering voluntarily. That way, they shall be eligible for tax credit.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><strong>What are various VAT rates?</strong></h3>
            <p>VAT rate is fixed to 5% for most services and goods.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><strong>Which goods and services are exempt from VAT?</strong></h3>
            <p>These are have 0% VAT applicable -
                <ul>
                    <li>Goods and services exported outside the GCC</li>
                    <li>Specific investment-grade precious metals (like silver and gold of 99% purity)</li>
                    <li>Certain supplies of education and healthcare</li>
                    <li>Freshly constructed residential properties sold within 3 years of construction.</li>
                    <li>International transportation</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The following are exempt from VAT – 
                <ul>
                    <li>Unconstructed land</li>
                    <li>Public transport</li>
                    <li>Residential properties</li>
                    <li>Certain financial services</li>
                    <li>Life insurance</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3><strong>Which records do I need to keep for VAT?</strong></h3>
            <p>It’s incorrect to think that if you don’t fall into the VAT regime, you don’t need to keep proper records. Even when your business is exempt from VAT, you will need some records in order to prove that you are exempt. If you have a business that needs a mandatory registration, you must keep proper books of accounts. But both kinds of businesses need to keep the following records –
                <ul>
                    <li>Invoices</li>
                    <li>Credit notes</li>
                    <li>Debit notes</li>
                </ul> 
            </p>
